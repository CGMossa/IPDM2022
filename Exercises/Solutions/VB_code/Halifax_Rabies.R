# Make a rabies model
# Consider structure, parameters, frequency/density (validation of outputs)

# What's new from previous model examples?
# Paraeterisation with distributions
# RGeode library - to use the function rgammatr to truncate the gamma distribution for Cx length
# SEIR model structure
# Increased consideration of Beta
# Change of states E-I and I-R based on distributions (Could also have done 1/gamma and binomial process)
# This pre-assigns a latent and infectious period should that dog become infected.

# Note: Is the pattern of the outbreaks what you would expect in a small community of dogs?

# Parameters -------------------------------------

# Probability of infection:
# What is beta made of?
# Probability of effective contact
# Probability of bite
# Probability of infection

DensityCoeff = 0.2  # If contact was based on density, how many more contacts would the dog have for every extra dog introduced to the area?
FrequencyContacts = 2  # If contact was based on rfequency, what is the average number of dog contacts per dog, regardless of desnsity?
Pbite = 0.3 # could include this is 'effective contact'
PInf = 0.5


# Duration of latent period
LPeriod_meanlog = 3.0
LPeriod_sdlog = 0.6

# Duration of infectious period

# We want to simulate 5 years:
end.time <- 1 * 365




# Community ---------------------------------------
n.dogs <- 220
# Create the community:
community <- data.frame(id =1:n.dogs,
                   age=round(runif(n.dogs,90,3650)),
                   state=0, 
                   latent.days = round(rlnorm (n.dogs, LPeriod_meanlog, LPeriod_sdlog)),
                   infected.days=round(rgammatr (n.dogs, IPeriod_shape, IPeriod_rate, range = c(2, 14))),
                   latent.count = 0,
                   infection.count = 0)

# We now have four compartments in the "infected" column:
# 0 = Susceptible
# 1 = latent
# 2 = Infectious
# 3 = Recovered

# Initial states -------------------------------------
# We start with one latently infected dog
community$state[1] <- 2



# Collections -----------------------------------------
# This community would notice 2 dogs being sick in one week. Otherwise infections would go unoticed

# Collect the :
age_collect <- numeric(end.time)
# Collect the number of susceptible and infected animals at each time point:
inf_collect <- data.frame(susceptible=rep(0,end.time), latent=rep(0, end.time), infected=rep(0, end.time), recovered=rep(0, end.time))



# Model -----------------------------------------------

for (k in 1:end.time)

  # We update the ProbInf within the model:
  
  # Density transmission
  # risk of infection = lambda
  # lambda = beta * I
  # lambda = c * v * I/N   c = prob contact (k* N/A), v = prob infection, I/N = probability that a given contact is with an infected individual 
  # lambda = k * v * I    K is the coefficient of the slope

  # risk of infection = lambda
  # lambda = beta' * I
  # lambda = c' * v * I/N   c = prob contact (n + 0*N/A), v = prob infection, I/N = probability that a given contact is with an infected individual 
  # lambda = n * v * I/N    n is the number of contacts/time step
  
  #ProbInfection <- FrequencyContacts * Pbite * PInf * (length(community$state[community$state==2])/n.dogs)

  ### Recovery ###
  
  # Identify the dogs that will 'recover' on this day:
  PotRec       <- which(community$state==2)
  # Draw randomly which of the dogs should recover:
  NewRec       <- PotRec[which(community$infected.days[PotRec]<=community$infection.count[PotRec])]
  # If there are any recoveries, they recover:
  if(length(NewRec)>0) community$state[NewRec] <- 3
  # And update the infected days counter (at each time step):
  community$infection.count[community$state==2] <- community$infection.count[community$state==2] + 1
  
  
  ### Infectious ###
  
  # Identify the dogs that will become infectious on this day:
  PotInf       <- which(community$state==1)
  # Draw randomly which of the dogs should recover:
  NewInf       <- PotInf[which(community$latent.days[PotInf]<=community$latent.count[PotInf])]
  # If there are any recoveries, they recover:
  if(length(NewInf)>0) community$state[NewInf] <- 2
  # And update the infected days counter (at each time step):
  community$latent.count[community$state==1] <- community$latent.count[community$state==1] + 1

  
  ### Latent Infection ###
  
  # Identify the dogs that will become latently infected on this day:
  PotLat       <- which(community$state==0)
  # Draw randomly which of the cows that should be (newly) infected:
  NewLat       <- PotLat[rbinom(length(PotLat),1,prob=ProbInfection)==1]
  # If there are new infections, then we infect them:
  if(length(NewLat)>0) community$state[NewLat] <- 1
 
  
  # Add one day to the age of all the animals, for each simulated:
  community$age <- community$age + 1
  
  # Save the daily mean age of all cows:
  age_collect[k] <- mean(community$age)
  
  # Save the number of susceptible, infected and recovered:
  sus <- length(community$state[community$state==0])
  lat <- length(community$state[community$state==1])
  inf <- length(community$state[community$state==2])
